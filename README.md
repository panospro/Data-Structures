# Data-Structures

## Trying to make a game about Theseus and the Minotaur in 4 projects

### The first project is a simple form of the game  
*There are some classes created:*
* Supply
* Tile
* Board
* Player
* Game  

*and some functions:*
* createTile
* createSupply
* createBoard
* getStringRepresentation
  
#### *Notes*: using getStringRepresentation we get a good visualization of the game and how it is played by the players

### The second project creates a better player to play against the Minotaur    
*There are some new classes created:*  
* HeuristicPlayer
* Game (different)

*and some functions:*  
* evaluate
* getNextMove
* statistics

### The third project creates a better player using a tree-like MinMax algorithm to make the best decisions
*There are some new classes created:*  
* Node
* MinMaxPlayer
* Game(different)

*and some functions:*  
* nodeEvaluation
* evaluate
* chooseMinMaxMove

### *Notes*: there might be some errors in the third project 

### *Disclaimer*: If there is an error in the code its from the translation and it's easily fixed (e.g ? -> ; , breaks? -> break;)
